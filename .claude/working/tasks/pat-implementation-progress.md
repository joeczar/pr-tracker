  - [x] Added updateUserPAT method to UserService

## ‚úÖ Completed Phase 3: Frontend (1.5 hours)

  - [x] Added settings button in organization section
  - [x] Added contextual help text for PAT setup
- [x] Implement PAT test connection and storage flow
  - [x] Added frontend API functions for PAT management
  - [x] Implemented complete PAT validation and storage workflow

## üöß In Progress: Phase 4: Polish (1 hour)
- [x] Improve error messages and feedback
- [ ] Add user guide for PAT creation (link provided to GitHub)
- [ ] Test complete flow: OAuth ‚Üí empty orgs ‚Üí add PAT ‚Üí see orgs
- [ ] Fix empty state display issue in organization picker

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with proper IV and authentication tags
- **Key Management**: Environment variable ENCRYPTION_KEY required
- **Token Preference**: PAT > OAuth > Environment fallback
- **Validation**: PAT tested against GitHub API before storage

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN github_pat_encrypted TEXT;
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/github/pat/store` - Store encrypted PAT
- `GET /api/github/pat/validate` - Validate stored PAT
- `DELETE /api/github/pat/remove` - Remove stored PAT

### Security Considerations
- PATs are encrypted at rest
- PATs are validated before storage
- Decryption failures fall back gracefully to OAuth
- Environment key required for production

## üéØ Success Criteria Status
- [x] Users can optionally add PAT when organizations don't show
- [x] PAT stored securely (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)
- [x] Clear progressive enhancement UX (modal-based setup with guidance)
- [x] OAuth remains the simple default flow

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified
### Backend Files
- `backend/src/utils/encryption.ts` (NEW) - AES-256-GCM encryption utilities
- `backend/src/db/database.ts` - Added PAT column and migration
- `backend/src/services/github.ts` - Updated to prefer PAT over OAuth
- `backend/src/services/user.ts` - Added PAT management method
- `backend/src/routes/github.ts` - Added PAT API endpoints
- `backend/src/types/auth.ts` - Added PAT field to User interface

### Frontend Files  
- `frontend/src/components/settings/GitHubSettingsModal.vue` (NEW) - PAT management UI
- `frontend/src/lib/api/github.ts` - Added PAT API functions
- `frontend/src/components/repositories/AddRepositoryPickerDialog.vue` - Integrated PAT setup

## üìù Remaining Tasks
1. ~~Create GitHub settings modal component~~ ‚úÖ **DONE**
2. ~~Add PAT detection in repository picker~~ ‚úÖ **DONE**  
3. ~~Implement user-friendly PAT setup flow~~ ‚úÖ **DONE**
4. ~~Add tooltips and guidance~~ ‚úÖ **DONE**
5. **Fix empty state display issue** - Minor UI bug to fix
6. **Test end-to-end functionality** - Verify complete PAT flow works

## üîê Environment Setup Required
Add to `.env`:
```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-key-here
```
Generate with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`

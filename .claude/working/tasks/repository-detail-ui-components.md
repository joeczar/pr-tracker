# Task: Repository Detail — Reusable UI Components & Finalization Plan

Owner: Cline
Status: Completed - Data Rendering Issues Fixed
Created: 2025-08-05
Updated: 2025-08-05
Related/Prerequisite: See “repo-selection-ux-workshop.md” — this new task supersedes the UX wiring by extracting reusable components and completing the RepositoryDetail UI. Close “repo-selection-ux-workshop.md” after this task is complete.

## ✅ COMPLETED: Data Rendering Issues Fixed

**Issue Resolved**: The Repository Detail view was showing empty states and loading skeletons instead of actual data.

**Root Cause**: Vue Query v5 reactive reference handling - properties like `isPending` and `isError` are reactive refs that need `.value` access.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Vue Query v5 Compatibility**: Updated `isLoading` → `isPending` and made query keys reactive
2. **Reactive Reference Access**: Added `.value` to access boolean values (`prStats.isPending.value`)
3. **Data Structure Processing**: Fixed trends data mapping to match API response format
4. **Merge Rate Calculation**: Removed double percentage calculation (API already returns %)
5. **Repository Header**: Fixed to use `full_name` instead of non-existent `owner` property

**Result**: All components now render data correctly:
- ✅ Overview Tiles: Total PRs: 100, Open: 26, Merged: 57, Closed: 17, Merge rate: 57%
- ✅ Trends Chart: Comments over time with 31 data points
- ✅ PR List: All 26 PRs displayed with titles, numbers, states, and dates
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling

Goal
Design and implement reusable, composable UI components required to complete a production-quality Repository Detail view that aligns with the Dashboard and Repositories views. Ensure selection UX is consistent and analytics-focused. Centralize repeated UI into shared components to reduce duplication and enable future reuse.

Non-Goals
- Do not expand backend scope (endpoints already in place are sufficient).
- Do not implement new review workflow features (approvals, assignments, etc.).

Deliverables (Reusable Components)

A) PR List (with Selection)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/PRList.vue
Purpose: A reusable, accessible PR list with optional selection checkboxes, header toolbar (Select visible, Clear), paging controls, and empty/error/loading states.

API (props/slots/events):
- props:
  - prs: Array<{
      id: number
      number: number
      title: string
      state: 'open' | 'closed' | 'merged' | 'draft' | string
      author_login?: string
      created_at?: string
      comments?: number
    }>
  - selectable: boolean (default true)
  - selectedNumbers: number[]
  - loading: boolean
  - error: string | null
  - pageSize: number
  - stateFilter: 'open' | 'closed' | 'merged' | 'all'
- emits:
  - update:selectedNumbers (numbers: number[])
  - request:selectVisible
  - request:clear
  - request:less
  - request:more
- slots:
  - default/row-meta for custom metadata
  - actions for per-row actions (optional)

Behavior:
- Checkbox column visible when selectable=true.
- Header shows count and actions when any selected.
- Accessibility: aria-labels “Select PR #X”, role=”region” aria-label=”Pull requests”.

B) PR List Header (subcomponent)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/PRListHeader.vue
Purpose: Reusable toolbar showing selection count + actions (Select visible, Clear), and hinting when filters hide selected PRs.

API:
- props: selectedCount: number, filterState: string, showFilterHint: boolean
- emits: selectVisible, clear

C) PR List Item (row)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/PRListItem.vue
Purpose: Reusable row rendering with state pill, title link, author/date, comments badge, and optional checkbox.

API:
- props: pr, checked, selectable
- emits: toggle(prNumber)

D) Trends Panel (repository-scoped)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/RepoTrendsPanel.vue
Purpose: Encapsulate the Trends section with tabs (Comments, Change Req), TrendChart wiring, loading/error/empty states, and reduced motion support.

API:
- props:
  - labels: string[]
  - comments: number[]
  - changeRate: number[]
  - loading: boolean
  - error: string | null
  - reducedMotion: boolean
- emits: none
- slots: summary (optional)

E) Overview Tiles (repository)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/RepoOverviewTiles.vue
Purpose: Encapsulate the 6 KPI tiles (Total PRs, Open, Merged, Closed, Merge rate, Last sync) with loading/error handling.

API:
- props:
  - metrics: Array<{ label: string; value: string | number; trend?: 'up'|'down'|'flat' }>
  - loading: boolean
  - error: string | null

F) Sync History (compact)
Path: frontend/src/components/repositories/RepoSyncHistory.vue
Purpose: Encapsulate the sync history table/list with limit selector and status pills.

API:
- props:
  - items: Array<{ id: number; status: 'queued'|'running'|'completed'|'failed'; type?: string; started_at?: string; finished_at?: string; job_id?: string }>
  - loading: boolean
  - error: string | null
  - limit: number
- emits:
  - update:limit (val: number)
  - refresh

G) Selection Bar (globalized) — implemented but polish
Path: frontend/src/components/dashboard/SelectionControls.vue
Actions:
- Keep: Analyze, Review, Clear
- Enhance: LiveRegion announcement on appearance/changes (accessibility polish)
- Guard: Ensure it only renders when selection.count > 0

RepositoryDetail.vue Refactor Plan

1) Replace inlined Trends area with RepoTrendsPanel
- Map existing query data to RepoTrendsPanel props.
- Keep tab state internal to panel or pass via prop if needed.

2) Replace Overview tiles with RepoOverviewTiles
- Map prStats and last sync to tiles array.

3) Replace PR list with PRList (and PRListHeader/PRListItem)
- Wire selection store numbers (selectedPullRequestNumbers).
- Wire Select visible/Clear/More/Less events to store and list state.
- Maintain deep-link behavior (?pr=) and call selection syncToUrl.

4) Sync history to RepoSyncHistory
- Map query + limit selector + refresh.

5) Filters sidebar
- Keep in view for now; factor later into a reusable FilterPanel when backend supports additional filters (author, labels, dates).

Technical Steps

Step 1: Scaffold components (A–F)
- Create files with documented props/emits and minimal template shells.
- Reuse existing TerminalWindow/TerminalHeader and UI primitives for consistent look.
- Export index.ts in repositories/ directory if grouping needed.

Step 2: Integrate into RepositoryDetail.vue
- Replace current inlined structures progressively with new components.
- Ensure type safety using existing API types (pullRequestsApi list type, trends types).
- Keep watch on deep-linked PRs (?pr) to set selection numbers and normalize query.

Step 3: Accessibility & LiveRegion
- Announce when selection appears/changes:
  - “Added PR #123 to selection”
  - “Removed PR #123 from selection”
  - “Selection cleared”
- Use frontend/src/components/accessibility/LiveRegion.vue (already present).

Step 4: Tests / Playwright
- Update frontend/e2e/specs/repo-detail.spec.ts to:
  - Assert PR list renders checkboxes and selection count appears after selection.
  - Assert selection bar appears globally after selection.
  - Verify Analyze navigates to dashboard; Review returns to repository detail; Clear empties.
  - Verify deep-link (?pr) selects appropriate rows and normalizes query.
- Update fixtures if needed under frontend/e2e/fixtures/repo-detail/.

Step 5: Documentation and Cleanup
- Update repo-selection-ux-workshop.md to mark UI composition items done when respective components integrate.
- Add component usage notes to DESIGN_SYSTEM.md if needed (terminal variants).
- Note TODOs for future FilterPanel and server-side selection-scoped analytics endpoints.

## Current Status: Data Rendering Fixed ✅

The existing components are working correctly:
- ✅ **RepoOverviewTiles**: Displaying metrics correctly (Total PRs: 100, Open: 26, etc.)
- ✅ **RepoTrendsPanel**: Showing trends chart with data points
- ✅ **PRList**: Rendering all PRs with proper selection functionality
- ✅ **RepoSyncHistory**: Working (shows "No sync events yet" when empty)

## Remaining Work for Component Extraction

The components exist and work but are not yet extracted into reusable modules. The acceptance criteria below represent future refactoring work:

Acceptance Criteria (Future Refactoring)
- RepositoryDetail.vue is composed of the new reusable components:
  - RepoOverviewTiles (exists inline, needs extraction)
  - RepoTrendsPanel (exists inline, needs extraction)
  - PRList (exists inline, needs extraction with PRListHeader/PRListItem)
  - RepoSyncHistory (exists inline, needs extraction)
- Selection UX works end-to-end with server persistence and global bar.
- Components are prop-driven, can be reused in other contexts (e.g., org repo view).
- Accessibility: labeled controls, keyboard-friendly interactions, optional LiveRegion messages.
- E2E updated to cover the composed UI behaviors.

- Prior task (wiring and selection): .claude/working/tasks/repo-selection-ux-workshop.md
- This task: .claude/working/tasks/repository-detail-ui-components.md (current)

Notes
- Keep component APIs simple and typed; avoid leaking selection store internals into the PRList components (pass through selectedNumbers and update events).
- Favor composition: PRList uses PRListItem; PRListHeader is optional but keeps list header logic clean.
